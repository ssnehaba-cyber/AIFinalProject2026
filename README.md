Time Series Forecasting with Attention Mechanism

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using deep learning.  
A synthetic dataset with multiple seasonal patterns is generated and preprocessed.  
A baseline LSTM model and an Attention-based LSTM model are implemented and compared.  
Performance is evaluated using RMSE and MAE metrics.  
The attention model shows improved accuracy over the baseline model.
